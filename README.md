## Project Overview üéâ

It is the backend part of the "Base PC" application which is an online store.

The application is a project made for the purposes of the diploma thesis at The Witelon State University of Applied Sciences in Legnica.

The store has the option of setting up two types of accounts (system
administrator and ordinary user).

Each of them has individual rights that define access to particular functions of the online store.
For example admins can manage products and categories but only ordinary users can
shop.
